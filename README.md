### Description

((UPDATED!!!)) I commented the code and added a "Generate Character Stats" button on the Add Character form... I still need to add some rules for the generation. This is a new program I am just beginning to work on. I would like ideas on what to add. It is far from finished, but like I said, I would like some ideas. It uses an Access2000 database (included) and I have included an executable.
